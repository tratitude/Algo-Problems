The checker for problem E was buggy during the contest.  It allowed teams to 
output numbers with an absolute value greater than 1000000.  When we released 
the archives, one team noticed that and reported to us.  We then fixed the 
checker and run it to verify all correct submissions again.  There are two 
misjudged submissions, but it is caused by the problem setter and the testers. 
We will not change the scores.  We apologize for the mistake.
